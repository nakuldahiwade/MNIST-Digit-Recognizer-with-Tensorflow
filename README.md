# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer-with-Tensorflow
This project builds a simple Deep Neural Network with three hidden layers using Tensorflow and then trains this network with MNIST training data (60,000) samples. Then it recognizes the handwritten digits against the MNIST testing data (10,000) samples with high accuracy. The aim of this project is to learn about Neural Networks and Tensorflow.
